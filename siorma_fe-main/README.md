### 💻 The Tech Powering Our Community 💻

We've chosen a modern and robust tech stack to ensure Siorma is fast, reliable, and a joy to use.

* **Next.js:** The core framework providing a powerful foundation with Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and incredible performance, making the app feel snappy and responsive.
* **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework that allows us to build a beautiful, custom design without leaving our HTML.
* **shadcn/ui:** We believe in stunning and accessible interfaces. Shadcn gives us a collection of elegant, composable components that are a pleasure to interact with.
* **Lucide Icons:** Crisp, clean, and consistent icons that enhance user experience and bring clarity to the interface.
* **React Context & Hooks:** For managing application state in a clean, predictable, and scalable way without the need for heavy external libraries.
